# CVP-datasets / Flash Flood Prediction Project

This repository contains code and data for a research project on flash flood prediction using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on developing a model called CVP (Catchment-based Vulnerability Predictor) for accurate prediction and evaluation of flash flood occurrences.

## Datasets

### Dataset 1: Catchment Characteristics
- Source: Environment Agency and University of Greenwich School of Engineering
- Description: Comprehensive catchment characteristics for all catchment stations within the study area (SWE).
- Features: 
  - Station location and coordinates
  - Wetness index (PROPWET)
  - Drainage path slope (DPSBAR)
  - Mean distances between nodes used to denote size (DPLBAR)
  - And more

### Dataset 2: Flash Flood Events
- Source: Hydrometric Southwest Region
- Time Range: April 12, 1960, to November 22, 2016
- Description: Compilation of all flash flood events along with corresponding NAO/AMO numbers.
- Usage: Basis for training the machine learning algorithms within CVP.

## Usage
- The code provided in this repository is aimed at training and evaluating the CVP model for flash flood prediction.
- You can explore the Jupyter notebooks for detailed implementation and analysis.
